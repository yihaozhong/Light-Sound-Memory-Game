## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/493296/css-display-an-image-resized-and-cropped
https://www.w3schools.com/css//css_font_websafe.asp

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The difficulty is to create the images under the button and make them hidden before the user clicks it. I was able to embed the images but failed to crop them in a proper size, and other than that, I was not able to make their position exactly the same under the buttons. I knew it can be done by arranging the positional variable of images under the CSS file but I did not manage to do so. I failed to debug the problems after looking up different resources on the internet. However, I had gained experience in creating images, making them invisible under button clicks, and embedding them along with audio files. Another difficulty is understanding the corresponding relationship among CSS files, Javascript files, and HTML files. It gradually made sense to me as I understand it as a developing tool package for a website rather than three separate programming languages. The most important thing to learn about web development is to utilize the search engine to debug and learn new features. This is the best way for me to overcome these difficulties. I searched for well-written articles on the Internet that help me understand the underlining principles of these programming languages.   

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
